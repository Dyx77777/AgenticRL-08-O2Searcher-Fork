## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks requiring open-domain up-to-date information. 
While enabling LLMs to interact with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse answers, remain underexplored.
To bridge this gap, we present O²-Searcher, a novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O²-Searcher leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies. 
Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct O²-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments show that O²-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses leading LLM agents on O²-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on par with much larger ones.

## Updates  📰
- **`2025-05-23:`** The paper is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16582).
- **`2025-05-22:`** We opensource O²-Searcher codebase and the QA data of O²-QA benchmark.


## Getting Started 🎯
### Installation
```bash
# Recommend Python 3.10.
cd O2-Searcher
conda create -n o2searcher python=3.10
conda activate o2searcher
pip install -e ./verl
pip install -e .
pip install wandb 
pip install uvicorn
pip install bs4
pip install tavily-python
```

### Data
1. Download the [nq_hotpotqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PeterJinGo/nq_hotpotqa_train/tree/main) dataset processed by [Search-R1](https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1) and put it in the [directory](o2searcher/data/nq_hotpotqa/).
2. Generate the hybrid dataset.
```bash
./scripts/data/o2searcher_dataset.py --split [SPLIT]
```   

### Training Scripts
The training procedure consists of two stages, i.e., Cold Start and GRPO Training:

1. Cold Start:
```bash
./scripts/train/run_o2searcher_sft.sh [GPU_NUM]
```

2. GRPO Training:
   
Before running the training script, you should launch the [local search environment]() and the metric server.

(1) Local search environment
```bash
# For open-ended queries
python o2searcher/searcher/run_openended.py --local_url [MEILISEARCH_URL]
# For closed-ended queries
python o2searcher/searcher/run_closedended.py --local_url [DENSE_RETRIVER_URL]
``` 
(2) Launch the metric server 
```bash
python o2searcher/rewards/metrics/server.py
``` 
(3) Training
```bash
./scripts/train/run_o2searcher_grpo.sh
```

We welcome the community to try out different models, context lengths, and RL parameters in the training scripts!

### Inference
Download the pretrained [weights](https://huggingface.co/Jianbiao/O2-Searcher-Qwen2.5-3B-GRPO).


1. Launch the [local search environment](./o2searcher/searcher/search_env/README.md) or use web searching as follows:
  
(1) Local search environment
```bash
# For open-ended queries
python o2searcher/searcher/run_openended.py --local_url [MEILISEARCH_URL]
# For closed-ended queries
python o2searcher/searcher/run_closedended.py --local_url [DENSE_RETRIVER_URL]
```
(2) Web search
```bash
python o2searcher/searcher/run_api_tavily.py
```
2. Run inference
```bash
python scripts/eval/infer_agent.py -m [MODEL_PATH] -q [QUERY] -t [TAG]
```

3. Test on O²-QA benchmark

(1) After launching the search environment, run inference on the test set
```bash
python scripts/eval/infer_agent.py -m [MODEL_PATH] -q ./script/eval/query_list.txt -t [TAG]
``` 
(2) Launch the metric server 
```bash
python o2searcher/rewards/metrics/server.py
``` 
(3) Run the test script
```bash
python script/eval/test_llm.py --generate_dir [GENERATE_DIR]
``` 

### Preliminary results
1. Chat cases

</p>

2. Incorporating open-ended data yields superior training stability, longer average
response lengths, and larger average search turns during the training procedure.
